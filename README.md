## Overview

This project aims to improve the messaging within NeoVim by removing references to a charity that supports a cause deemed undesirable. In its place, we promote credible organizations that are dedicated to making a positive difference in the community.

## Why This Fork?

Many charitable organizations may support causes that do not align with the values of the community or that have negative impacts. This fork seeks to ensure that users are informed about and encouraged to support charities that contribute to meaningful and beneficial causes.
